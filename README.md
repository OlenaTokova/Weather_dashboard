While working on this project, I started to understand and learn the intricacies of integrating APIs for real-time data retrieval, the importance of data visualization for better user experience, and the power of custom CSS to create visually appealing web applications. Additionally, I gained hands-on experience with Streamlit for building interactive web apps efficiently.
